# Princeton Restaurants

Welcome to the Princeton Restaurants Inspection Repository

## Goals
Create a web page for the Princeton Department of Public Health that allows site visitors to find the health scores of their favorite places to eat.


## Dataset Information
Data given by the Princeton Department of Public Health and contains rating for 2014 and 2015 [ongoing since it is annual inspection]

## Ideas for Data Usage
Suggest some!

Yelp currently supports displaying Health Scores from Municipality which has been adopted by SF, NYC and LA [ongoing]. We explored this option with the Muni but they want to have to their web page as phase 1.
